# Abstract

> We present a new method of learning control policies that successfully operate `under unknown dynamic models`. We create such policies by leveraging a large number of training examples that are generated using a physical simulator. Our system is made of two components: a `Universal Policy (UP)` and a function for `Online System Identification (OSI)`. We describe our control policy as universal because it is trained over a wide array of dynamic models. These variations in the dynamic model may include `differences in mass and inertia of the robots components, variable friction coefficients, or unknown mass of an object to be manipulated`. By training the Universal Policy with this variation, the control policy is prepared for a wider array of possible conditions when executed in an unknown environment. The second part of our system `uses the recent state and action history of the system to predict the dynamics model parameters µ`. The value of µ from the Online System Identification is then `provided as input to the control policy` (along with the system state). Together, UP-OSI is a robust control policy that can be used across a wide range of dynamic models, and that is also responsive to sudden changes in the environment. We have evaluated the performance of this system on a variety of tasks, including the problem of cart-pole swing-up, the double inverted pendulum, locomotion of a hopper, and block-throwing of a manipulator. UP-OSI is effective at these tasks across a wide range of dynamic models. Moreover, when tested with dynamic models outside of the training range, UP-OSI `outperforms` the Universal Policy alone, `even when UP is given the actual value of the model dynamics`. In addition to the benefits of creating more robust controllers, UP-OSI also holds out the promise of `narrowing the Reality Gap between simulated and real physical systems`.
