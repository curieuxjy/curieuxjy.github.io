# Issue

Error Message

```commandline
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findament_cmake.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ament_cmake", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ament_cmake" with
  any of the following names:

    ament_cmakeConfig.cmake
    ament_cmake-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ament_cmake" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ament_cmake_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ament_cmake" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
```

# Solution

This error typically appears when CMake cannot locate ament_cmake. In ROS 2, ament_cmake is a core build system package that you must have installed (and sourced) before building any ament-based packages.

Ensure the ament_cmake package is actually installed. On Ubuntu, for Humble, you’d expect something like:

If you have a minimal or custom ROS 2 installation, you might need to install additional packages to get ament_cmake.
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-ament-cmake
```
